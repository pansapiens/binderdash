# Binderdash

![Binderdash: the design table with scores, and a binder-target complex in the structure viewer](images/binderdash-hero.png)

**Binderdash is a tool to streamline filtering, ranking and construct design for de novo protein binders.**

Point it at the output folders from your design runs and it presents the scores and structures in one interface. Filter, rank and export ready-to-order DNA constructs.

## Features

- **Reads your runs as they are.** Supports run output folders from RFdiffusion, RFdiffusion3, BindCraft and BoltzGen. Binderdash detects `nf-binder-design` pipeline outputs and imports with no reformatting needed.
- **One table across runs and methods.** Sort and compare designs from different runs side by side. Common metrics (ipTM, interface PAE, RMSD, pLDDT) are matched across pipelines that name them differently.
- **3D structure viewer.** Built on Mol\*. Step through designs, colour by chain or pLDDT, overlay a reference structure, and mark designs as good or bad as you go.
- **Filtering and ranking.** Combine score thresholds with target-contact conditions (for example "binds within 5 Å of these epitope residues"), rank on several metrics at once, and pick a shortlist that balances score against sequence diversity. The filter cascade UI shows how many designs each condition removes. See [Filtering and ranking](usage/filtering-ranking.md).
- **Plots.** Scatterplots and histograms of any two metrics against each other.
- **Saved sets.** Keep a shortlist together with the filters and ranking that produced it, and come back to it later.
- **Construct design.** Add N- or C-terminal affinity tags and linkers (His, FLAG, Strep-tag II, AviTag and others) and codon-optimise with synthesis complexity constraints, including GC content, hairpins and restriction sites. Generate short names compatible with DNA synthesis vendors naming rules. Export Twist-ready CSVs.
- **Reproducible downloads.** A design bundle holds the structures, sequences and tables together with the selections, filters and settings that produced them, so a shortlist can be traced and restored later.
- **Bring your own data.** Upload a TSV of extra columns (for example lab results) and merge it onto designs by ID to use for filtering and ranking.
- **Desktop or shared server.** Run it on your own machine, or host one instance for a group with sign-in (local accounts, Unix/PAM or Google), per-user API keys, and an optional [MCP endpoint](development/mcp.md) and [REST API](development/api.md) for AI agents.

## Getting started

- **[Desktop app](setup/desktop.md)**: download a build for Linux, macOS or Windows from the [latest release](https://github.com/pansapiens/binderdash/releases/latest). Best for one person exploring runs on their own machine.
- **[Server with Docker](setup/docker.md)**: host one instance for a group, with HTTPS and [sign-in](setup/authentication.md).

## For developers

- [Development setup](development/setup.md): run from source, tests, and building these docs
- [REST API](development/api.md) and [MCP server](development/mcp.md)
- [Adding a pipeline method type](development/pipeline-methods.md)
