# Desktop app

The desktop app is the full Binderdash interface in a native window, for use on a single machine. It needs no server, Docker or sign-in: it stores its database in your user profile and reads run folders directly from your disk.

## Download and install

Download the file for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/pansapiens/binderdash/releases/latest).

The builds are not code-signed, so macOS and Windows ask you to confirm the first launch.

### Linux

Download `Binderdash-<version>-x86_64.AppImage`, make it executable and run it:

```bash
chmod +x Binderdash-*-x86_64.AppImage
./Binderdash-*-x86_64.AppImage
```

The AppImage needs the system WebKitGTK and GTK 3 libraries (on Debian/Ubuntu: `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-0` and `libgtk-3-0`) and FUSE (`libfuse2`) to mount itself.

### macOS (Apple silicon)

1. Unzip `Binderdash-<version>-macos-arm64.zip`.
2. Double-click `Binderdash.app`.

If macOS blocks the app, right-click it and choose **Open**, or clear the quarantine flag:

```bash
xattr -cr Binderdash.app
```

### Windows

1. Unzip `Binderdash-<version>-win64.zip` anywhere.
2. Run `Binderdash.exe`.

The app uses the Microsoft Edge [WebView2 runtime](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/), which is already installed on current Windows 10 and 11. If SmartScreen warns about an unsigned app, choose **More info**, then **Run anyway**.

## Loading your runs

1. Open **Ingest Runs** and use **Choose folder** to pick the folder that contains your design runs. The path is saved for future sessions.
2. Scan the folder tree and ingest the runs you want. Binderdash detects RFdiffusion, RFdiffusion3, BindCraft and BoltzGen output layouts.
3. Tick runs in **Select Runs**, then explore them in **Designs**, **Plots** and **Filtering**.

Ingesting reads your results into the app's database. It never modifies or deletes files in the run folders, and removing a run from Binderdash leaves the files on disk untouched.

## Where data is stored

| OS | Location |
| --- | --- |
| Linux | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/binderdash` or `~/.local/share/binderdash` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Binderdash` |
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Binderdash` |

This folder holds `binderdash.sqlite` (the database), `desktop.json` (folder and window settings) and `binderdash.log`. If the app fails to start, check `binderdash.log` first.
