# Docker deployment

This page describes running Binderdash as a shared server with Docker Compose.

## Overview

The application is containerized using a single Docker image that:

- Builds the frontend (Vue.js + Vite) during the Docker build process
- Serves both the backend API and frontend static files via FastAPI
- Mounts data directories as read-only volumes for security
- Includes health checks and resource limits

For PAM authentication inside Docker (bind-mounting `/etc/passwd`/`/etc/group`/`/etc/shadow`, the `shadow` group requirement, and container-recreate gotchas), see [Authentication setup](authentication.md#auth-type-3-pam-usernamepassword-unix-accounts).

## Prerequisites

### Host Directory Setup

Before running the containerized application, ensure the directories specified in `RUN_BASE_DIRS` exist and are accessible on the host. They should contain your protein binder design run data; the container mounts them as read-only volumes.

```bash
# Example: make directories readable by the container user (see "Container user" below)
sudo chmod -R a+rX /data/runs /data2/runs
```

### Environment Configuration

1. **Create `.env` file**: copy from `.env.example` and configure:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Set the container user** to your own uid and gid (see [Container user](#container-user) for why):

   ```bash
   printf 'BINDERDASH_UID=%s\nBINDERDASH_GID=%s\n' "$(id -u)" "$(id -g)" >> .env
   ```

3. **Configure your environment variables** in the `.env` file:

   ```bash
   # Required: set the paths to your data directories
   RUN_BASE_DIRS="/data/runs,/data2/runs"

   # Optional: Google OAuth allowlist (use with GOOGLE_AUTH_* vars)
   GOOGLE_AUTH_ALLOWED_USERS="user1@example.com,user2@example.com"

   # Optional: for local authentication (dev only)
   LOCAL_USERS="alice:$2b$12$...,bob:$2b$12$..."
   ```

Docker Compose automatically loads all environment variables from the `.env` file.

### Mounting your run directories

`RUN_BASE_DIRS` is read inside the container, so each directory must be mounted into the `binderdash` service and listed by its **container** path. For example, to serve runs from `/data/runs` on the host, add a volume in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  binderdash:
    volumes:
      - /data/runs:/data/runs:ro
```

and set `RUN_BASE_DIRS="/data/runs"` in `.env`. Binderdash only reads run folders, so a read-only mount is sufficient.

### Database directory

The SQLite database lives under `./data` on the host (mounted at `/app/data`) and is created on first start. The `data/` directory is part of the repository, so it exists after cloning, owned by you.

### Container user

The `binderdash` container never runs as root. It runs as the numeric user and group given by two variables in `.env`:

| Variable | Meaning | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BINDERDASH_UID` | User ID the container process runs as | `1000` |
| `BINDERDASH_GID` | Group ID the container process runs as | `1000` |

Files the container creates in `./data` (the SQLite database and its `-wal`/`-shm` files) are owned by this uid and gid on the host. The same ids need read access to your run directories. Setting them to your own ids means:

- `./data`, which you own after cloning, is writable without a `chown`
- run directories you can read, the container can read
- the database files on the host belong to you, so you can back up, copy or delete them without `sudo`

To set them to the user you are logged in as:

```bash
printf 'BINDERDASH_UID=%s\nBINDERDASH_GID=%s\n' "$(id -u)" "$(id -g)" >> .env
```

This writes literal numbers into `.env`, for example `BINDERDASH_UID=1001`. Use numbers, not `$UID`: Compose substitutes variables in `.env` only from its own environment, and bash does not export `UID` and does not define a `GID` variable at all. A `$UID` in `.env` therefore resolves to an empty string, Compose prints a `"UID" variable is not set` warning, and the container falls back to 1000.

Check the result with:

```bash
docker compose config | grep 'user:'
```

If you change the ids after the database exists, give `./data` to the new owner and recreate the container (`docker compose restart` keeps the old user):

```bash
sudo chown -R <uid>:<gid> data
docker compose up -d
```

The variables are read by Docker Compose only; the Binderdash backend ignores them. They apply to `docker-compose.dev.yml` too.

### HTTPS with Caddy

`docker-compose.yml` runs a [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) reverse proxy on ports 80 and 443 in front of Binderdash. Set `DOMAIN` in `.env` to the server's public hostname and Caddy obtains a TLS certificate automatically. With `DOMAIN` unset, Caddy serves `https://localhost` with a locally issued certificate. Also set `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to your site URL, and set a fixed `SECRET_KEY` so sign-in sessions survive restarts.

## Building and Running

### Production Mode

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker compose build
# Or build with no cache (if you need a fresh build)
docker compose build --no-cache

# Start the application
docker compose up
# Run in detached mode
docker compose up -d
# View logs
docker compose logs -f
# Stop the application
docker compose down
```

Development with live reloading (`docker-compose.dev.yml`) is covered in [Development setup](../development/setup.md#docker-development-mode).

## Health Checks

The application includes health checks that verify the FastAPI server is responding on `/health`, run every 30 seconds with a 10-second timeout.

```bash
# View health status
docker compose ps

# Test health endpoint directly
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

## Resource Limits

The container is configured with resource limits:

- **Memory**: 2GB limit, 512MB reservation
- **CPU**: 1.0 CPU limit, 0.5 CPU reservation

Adjust these in `docker-compose.yml` if needed for your environment.

## Security Considerations

1. **Non-root user**: the container runs as `BINDERDASH_UID`:`BINDERDASH_GID` (default 1000:1000), never root
2. **Read-only volumes**: data directories are mounted as read-only
3. **Environment variables**: sensitive configuration is passed via environment variables, not baked into the image
4. **Network**: only Caddy (ports 80 and 443) is exposed to the host; the Binderdash container listens on port 8000 on the internal Compose network

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission denied on data directories**: the container user (see [Container user](#container-user)) must be able to read the run directories and write `./data`. Either set `BINDERDASH_UID`/`BINDERDASH_GID` to the owner, or make the directories readable:

   ```bash
   sudo chmod -R a+rX /data/runs /data2/runs
   ```

2. **Container won't start**:

   ```bash
   docker compose logs binderdash
   netstat -tulpn | grep :8000
   cat .env
   ```

3. **Health check failing**:

   ```bash
   curl -v http://localhost:8000/health
   docker compose logs -f binderdash
   ```

4. **Frontend not loading**:
   - Ensure the frontend was built during the Docker build process
   - Check that static files are being served correctly
   - Verify the build output in the container: `docker compose exec binderdash ls -la /app/backend/static/`

### Debugging

```bash
# Access the container shell
docker compose exec binderdash /bin/bash

# Check application status
docker compose exec binderdash ps aux
```

## Production Deployment

For production deployment:

1. **Use a reverse proxy** (nginx, traefik, or Caddy — see `Caddyfile` and `DOMAIN` in `.env.example`) in front of the container
2. **Set up SSL/TLS** termination at the reverse proxy
3. **Configure proper logging** and log rotation
4. **Set up monitoring** and alerting
5. **Use secrets management** for sensitive environment variables
6. **Consider using Docker Swarm or Kubernetes** for orchestration

### Example nginx configuration

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```
